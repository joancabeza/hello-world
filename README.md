# hello-world
A place to store ideas, resources, or even share and discuss things with others

Since I finished the studies of architecture  in the ETSAB (Architecture Superior School  of Barcelona) in five years, and having been recruited  by my former project professor, Ramon Sanabria, in whose company I was working for 6 years, I can say that with this experience  (together  with  my experience in England, China and others) I have participated in several public buildings highlighting The Andorra’s Parliament, Granollers Natural Sciences Museum, Barcelona University Campus,  Viladecans primary care center, Canovelles Primary School, and Balaguer’s Court Building. I also have participated in single family houses (doing site management), housing buildings, offices, refurbishment, landscaping and urban planning projects.

I reinforced my skills in BIM methodology with tools as Revit, Navisworks and Tekla Bimsight and also my organizational skill with a MBA degree. Nowadays I am improving my knowledge in industrial facilities and open-source tools.


I consider myself a creative that uses rationality to make the ideas ordered and a team-player who understands that to reach the targets, the best of every team member have to be explored and considered.
